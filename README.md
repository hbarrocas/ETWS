## Etienne's Toy Work Station (ETWS)

A minimalistic menu system created to launch functions that works around the idea of generating ASCII graphics.

The project, however, is not about the menu system or the ASCII graphics; this software is, and will always be, far from reaching major software stores, or being the next graphics design tool to have.

Written by Etienne Delacroix around examples of how to create an object from Rosetta Code (https://rosettacode.org), this software begins life as C code that creates a minimalistic shell (no complex programming at all) with enough capability to draw a line on screen. The software is then extended to allow access to a REPL in order to interact with functions that initially, are just called from the menu.

Well, that's the first idea.

Then, the same concept is rewritten in a different language (smalltalk, Forth, Javascript, Julia, python have been used) attempting to shape on each of these languages a nearly identical object to the original C code.

We all know different languages have been invented for different purposes and have different features, advantages and disadvantages. Exploring these differences while realising the fact that, the same way that writing a poem is not about the language or, driving is not just about shifting gears and knowing where your wipers are, programming is not just about the language.
